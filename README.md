# Project: Introduction to MySQL

The SQL script in this project includes the commands required to create tables `Students` and `Courses` and insert sample data into them (10 rows each).

The script also includes commands to insert additional entries, view all the entries in the `Students` table, and reassign the `age` value of a specific student entry.

## Understanding Database Basics

***In your words, what is a database?***

A database is a digital system we can use to store, organize, and manage information. I can think of it as an online filing cabinet with multiple siles, each containing a specific group of data with their own properties and values. This organized system can help us find, update, or remove data quickly and easily. Databases are used everywhereâ€”most of the time without us noticing: from websites and apps to business management, the use of databases is involved in almost every data-related aspect of our everyday lives.


## Reflection questions
***Why did you choose specific data types for the columns in the Students table?***

I used `VARCHAR()` for any non-numeric values and added a limit argument in order to make their length consistent across entries. On the other hand, I used the `INT` type for numeric values as they did not require any use of decimals.

***What are some benefits of using databases over simple file storage systems?***

Using databases provide more organized, accessible, secure, and robust data storage and management.
