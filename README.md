# Project: Introduction to MySQL

The SQL script in this project includes the commands required to create tables `Students` and `Courses` and insert sample data into them (10 rows each).

## Reflection questions
***Why did you choose specific data types for the columns in the Students table?***

I used `VARCHAR()` for any non-numeric values and added a limit argument in order to make their length consistent across entries. On the other hand, I used the `INT` type for numeric values as they did not require any use of decimals.

***What are some benefits of using databases over simple file storage systems?***

Using databases provide more organized, accessible, secure, and robust data storage and management.
